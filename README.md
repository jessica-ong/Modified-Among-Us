**"main" is our code!**

# Modified-Among-Us
We recreated the classic game Flappy Bird into the Among Us Universe!

## Inspiration
Among Us and Flappy Bird

## What it does
It's a flappy bird game, but instead it's an Among Us character trying not to run into other Among Us characters (possibly because of coronavirus...)

## How we built it
We used python and collaborated using replit

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult writing for a whole new project, since none of us have that much programming experience

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we're proud of getting the images of among us characters in (it was actually difficult, we know that little)

## What we learned
We learned a lot about working as a team on programs, and about Python in general

## What's next for Modified Among Us
We don't know yet :)
